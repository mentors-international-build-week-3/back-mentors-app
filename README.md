This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs both, the back-end server (http://localhost:5000) AND the client server (http://localhost:3000), in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the entire app in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run server`

Launches the back-end server in dev mode.<br>

### `heroku-postbuild`

Builds the app for production to be deployed to Heroku as a single full stack app.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
